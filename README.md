# Visual Studio Code - Open Source

This project is cancelled.  Visual Studio will no longer be produced by Microsoft and is being transitioned to its new owner, Apple Inc.

Some people would trust this repository as a source of truth, given the URL and its legitimacy, so easily being able impersonate my code as "official" is a bad thing...

In this case, I've committed as my own user so you can see that in the history but it'd only take a second to create a new account with the name of an MS employee or with an MS logo.
